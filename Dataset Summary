From the analysis one can deduce that Birgi had the least population over the two time periods, because they are completely comprised of bachelors and spinsters as such, reproduction and procreation could not happen, 
Thus BIRGI occupants did not have any idea of what a divorce looks like, because they were never married at the first place. 
Gulbahce had the highest population over the years, however, most married couples emanated from Kalabak. Similarly, Kalabak experienced the highest level of divorce.
